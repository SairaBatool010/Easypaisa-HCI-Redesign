# Easypaisa User Interface Redesign Using HCI Principles

In this project, I focused on identifying and addressing usability issues in the Easypaisa app through user-centered design, based on feedback from user interviews and surveys. Using HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) principles and guidelines, I proposed solutions to enhance the overall user experience. These improvements aim to make the app more intuitive, accessible, and efficient, particularly for users with varying needs, such as senior citizens, visually impaired individuals, and illiterate users.

## Key Features of the Redesign:
- **Affordance and Metaphors:** I redesigned icons and interface elements for better clarity and alignment with real-world concepts.
- **Streamlined Task Flows:** I simplified common tasks like sending money to reduce unnecessary steps and improve efficiency.
- **Error Prevention and Clear Messaging:** I added error prevention mechanisms and clearer error messages to avoid confusion during transactions.
- **Undo Options and Flexibility:** I included an undo button for quick error correction and a home button to reduce frustration.
- **Improved Navigation:** I introduced breadcrumbs and clearer navigation paths to help users track their position in the app.
- **Accessibility Enhancements:** I implemented a voice-enabled option for visually impaired users.
- **Search Functionality:** I added search features in key areas like "View All" to enhance discoverability.
- **Enhanced Transaction History:** I provided more detailed and informative transaction histories.
- **Mini-Apps Categorization:** I grouped mini-apps into logical categories and replaced scrollers with a grid view for easier navigation.

## Methodology:
- **User Research:** I began by conducting surveys and interviews to identify the usability problems within the current Easypaisa app. Common issues included confusion around affordances, difficult navigation, lack of error prevention, and inadequate accessibility.
- **Design Approach:** Using insights gathered from the user research, I applied various HCI principles such as visibility of system status, recognition over recall, user control, and flexibility. The redesign also incorporated usability heuristics like consistency, error prevention, and minimalist design.
- **User-Centered Design:** All changes were implemented to cater to a diverse range of users, with a focus on improving task efficiency, accessibility, and clarity in the app's interface.

## Impact:
- The redesigned Easypaisa app is now more user-friendly, accessible, and efficient. Users can now navigate tasks with ease, make transactions confidently, and enjoy a more intuitive interface.
